# 🚀 Welcome to Your Roblox Coding Adventure!

Hey future game developers! Before we start building disco floors and magic portals, we need to set up your "Developer Laboratory."

## 🛠️ Step 1: Getting the Tools (Roblox Studio)
To make games, you need a special program called **Roblox Studio**. This is the same tool professional developers use to make the games you see on the Front Page!

### 📥 How to Download
1.  **Visit the Website:** Go to [roblox.com/create](https://www.roblox.com/create).
2.  **Start Creating:** Click the big **"Start Creating"** button. 
3.  **Install:** A file will download to your computer. Open it and follow the instructions to install.

> **Note for Parents:** Roblox Studio works on **Windows** and **macOS**. It does not work on Chromebooks, iPads, or phones.

## 👤 Step 2: Your Developer Account
To use Studio, you must log in with a **Roblox Account**.

* **Saving Your Magic:** Your account saves your games to the "Cloud" so you can work on them from any computer.
* **The Toolbox:** It gives you access to the **Toolbox**, where you can find character templates and cool items to add to your world.
* **Safety Tip:** Make sure your account has a parent's email attached so you never lose your hard work!

## 🌕 Step 3: What is "Lua"?
When we write code in Roblox, we are speaking a language called **Lua**.

* **It means "Moon":** In Portuguese, Lua means Moon! 🌑
* **It's a Translator:** Computers don't speak English. Lua is the "translator" that lets you tell the computer, *"Hey! Make that character jump!"* and the computer understands.
* **Why Lua?** It is famous for being fast and easy to learn. It's the perfect first language for a pro coder.

## 🖥️ Step 4: Finding Your Way Around
When you open Roblox Studio, make sure you can see the **Three Secret Windows**. If you don't see them, click the **View** tab at the top and click their buttons to turn them on!

1.  **The Explorer:** This is your list of "Ingredients." It shows every brick, character, and script in your game.
2.  **Properties:** This is where you change how things look—like their Color, Size, or if they are made of Neon or Grass!
3.  **The Output:** This is the most important window for a coder. It’s where the computer "talks" to you. If your code has a mistake, it will show up here in **Red Text**.

## 🚦 Your First Mission: The "Hello World" Test
Let's make sure your computer is listening to you!

1.  Open Roblox Studio and pick the **Baseplate** template.
2.  In the **Explorer** window (on the right), look for a folder called **ServerScriptService**.
3.  Click the white **(+)** and add a **Script**.
4.  Delete the text that is already there and type this: 
    ```lua
    print("I am a game developer!")
    ```
5.  Press the blue **Play** button at the top. 
6.  Look at your **Output** window. Did it say your message? 

**If you see that message, you just wrote your first line of Lua code! You are ready for Lesson 1.**
